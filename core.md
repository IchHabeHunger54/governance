# Governance of the NeoForged project

The NeoForged Project ("the Project") is a community of volunteers, maintaining a free and open source ecosystem of modifications to the Minecraft game. It is split between [GitHub](https://github.com/NeoForged) and [Discord](https://discord.neoforged.net).

All contributors and team members are here for fun. Our goal is to provide joy to the community, and to ourselves.

This document serves to ensure that the Project doesn't become so bureaucratic or so much of a chore that the fun is removed for anybody.

## What This Document Is

This document is:

- A non-exhaustive list of the working principles of the project.
- Intended to help guide the project in times of uncertainty.

This document is built on the fundamental principle of "people generally want to help, so we should not get in the way of it".

The core ethic is "people over processes", so this document is intentionally light on processes - situations that come up are rarely one-size-fits-all, and should be treated on a case by case basis, with the best process to fit the person.

## What This Document Is Not

This document is not:

- Intended to enforce rules on all members.
- Intended to catch all possibilities.
- Intended to prevent "rules lawyering".

The Code of Conduct of the project is taken to be the content of [the Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/), so this document is not the Code of Conduct. However, this may be altered with a copy held and maintained by the Project, only with overwhelming majority support by the entire team.

Conflict resolution is a duty split between the Moderators and Steering Council; the former for interpersonal disputes in and with the community, and the latter for development-related disputes in the Project itself. Either team may wish to append a section to this document, but currently, this document is not conflict resolution.

## Subprojects

A subproject is a part of the development effort of the NeoForged project. A subproject is commonly organized under:

- A GitHub repository
- A collection of GitHub repositories
- A specific branch, or specific branches, in one or multiple existing GitHub repositories
- A specialized Discord channel
- Any combination of the above

The most important subproject of the Project is NeoForge, which is the main product shipped to end users and maintained by the Maintainers team. Other subprojects may be managed by either a subteam or the Maintainers team.

## Teams

A team is a group of people with similar goals, and equal weighting in most decision making - with some exceptions, which will be explored later.

The Project consists of three main teams and several subteams. Members of a main team are not necessarily members of a subteam, and vice versa. Any person who is a member of a main team or a subteam gains equal voting rights in all team-wide decisions, regardless of the number of teams they are in.

Some teams can be joined via [application](https://links.neoforged.net/apply), while others require being appointed by an existing team member.

### Steering Council

The Steering Council ("the Council") is the overall management and oversight committee of the Project. They “steer” the project to keep it aligned with the long-term vision, hence its secondary name of Vision Team.

The Council also serves double duty as a mediator for disagreements between other teams. These shall be resolved by discussion, rather than by unanimous applications of the rules, so this is not in the purview of this document.

However, the Council does not have all-encompassing powers. They are the avenue of last resort, and the vast majority of decisions should be made by the team in charge, not by the Steering Council. The Council has these powers to resolve the 1% of exceptional situations, not the 99%.

The Council has at all times an odd number of active members, such that stalemates are not possible.

A member may choose to become inactive and appoint another in their place until they return.

The Council is elected annually from among the team members. This process is outlined in the [Voting document](voting.md).

### Maintainers

The Maintainers team consists of all developers who have push access or technical rights (write permissions to a subproject's GitHub repository, or access to the Project's servers) to the NeoForge repository, and to all repositories not managed by a subteam (see below).

They are the ones keeping the repositories they are assigned up to date, and ensuring the quality and standards of the Project are upheld, as well as adding new features as the community comes to require them.

Though Maintainers may individually or collectively have different access rights across the project's many repositories, all Maintainers within the team are considered equal to each other with respect to their rights within the team's governance.

Maintainers may join the team through [application](https://links.neoforged.net/apply). The existing team will then evaluate the application based on their past contributions to the Project and their way of working with the Maintainers so far.

Maintainers have no jurisdiction or weight in moderating or managing the community, unless the Maintainer in question is also a Moderator.

### Moderators

The Moderators team is composed of all moderators of all community spaces (GitHub, Discord) under the purview of the project.

They have the responsibility of enforcing the policies and rules of each space, as well as the Code of Conduct, and applying disciplinary sanctions to people who violate said rules. This mainly refers to the rules of interactions between people, and not so much to technical rules or guidelines.

Maintainers may join the team through [application](https://links.neoforged.net/apply). The existing team will then evaluate the application based on their past behavior in the Project's community spaces and their way of working with the community members so far.

Unless a Moderator is also a Maintainer, they cannot influence technical decisions, but they can still express their opinion, just as any other person.

### Subteams

Any team member may request for the Steering Council to create a subteam for a specific subproject. People may be appointed to a subproject by the Steering Council, or join the subteam via [application](https://links.neoforged.net/apply), or both; whatever is seen fit for the subproject in question.

Subteam members are part of the overall NeoForged team, and as such eligible to vote in project-wide decisions.

### External Teams

External teams are teams that are explicitly not part of the NeoForged project itself, but have been granted permission by the NeoForge team to use the project's spaces for their own external project's communication. This is usually because the external project is closely associated with the NeoForged Project in some way.

External team members are not part of the NeoForged team and as such not permitted to vote in internal affairs. Depending on the external project's relevance to the NeoForged Project, access to internal team channels may or may not be granted.

A notable external team is the team consisting of Mojang staff, which have great relevance to the Project due to developing Minecraft, which is the base software NeoForge modifies.

## Other Things To Note

Nobody is above the rules. All members of the team (even the Steering Council!) are to be held to these rules, with no exceptions granted for any individual or group.
